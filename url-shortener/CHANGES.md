AI Tool Usage

Tools Used:

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

GitHub Copilot (not used in this case)


What I Used It For:

Writing initial boilerplate code for FastAPI routes and logic.

Clarifying error messages and fixing test-related issues.

Providing instructions on setting up and running the project.


Modifications & Human Involvement:

All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and modified as necessary to meet the project constraints.

I avoided implementing disallowed features such as:

User authentication

Custom short codes

Web UI

Rate limiting

Use of external databases


Rejected Suggestions:

Suggestions involving external database integrations were not implemented.

Web UI and login/auth features proposed by AI were explicitly ignored to stay within scope.
